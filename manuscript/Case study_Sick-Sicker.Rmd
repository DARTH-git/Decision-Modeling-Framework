## Case-study: Sick-Sicker ##
A hypothetical disease affects individuals with an average age of 25 years and results in increased mortality, increased treatment costs and reduced quality of life. The disease has two levels; affected individuals initially become sick but can subsequently progress and become sicker. Two alternative strategies exist for this hypothetical disease: a no-treatment and a treatment strategy. Under the treatment strategy, individuals who become sick or progress and become sicker receive treatment and continue doing so until they recover or die. The cost of the treatment is additional to the cost of being sick or sicker for one year. The treatment improves quality of life for those individuals who are sick but has no effect on the quality of life of those who are sicker. You are asked to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment assuming a willingness to pay of $80000. 

To model this disease, we will rely on a state-transition cohort model, called the Sick-Sicker model, first described by Enns et al. The Sick-Sicker model consists of four health states: healthy (H), two disease states sick (S1) and sicker (S2) and dead (D) (Figure 1). All individuals start in the healthy state. Over time, healthy individuals may develop the disease and can progress to S1. Individuals in S1 can recover (return to state H), progress further to S2 or die. Individuals in S2 cannot recover (i.e. cannot transition to either S1 or H). Individuals in H are assumed to have a fixed mortality rate and individuals in S1 and S2 have an increased mortality rate compared to healthy individuals. These rates are used to calculate the probabilities to die when in S1 and S2.

Below, we show how to input the parameters in `R`. For the most up to date code, please visit [GitHub](https://github.com/DARTH-git/). We use the prefixes "`m.`" or "`v.`" to represent a matrix or a vector, respectively, consistent with our previous tutorial.[@Krijkamp2018] 

```{r Model-Params, eval=TRUE}
## General setup
age     <- 25         # age at baseline
max.age <- 55         # maximum age of follow up
n.t <- max.age - age # time horizon, number of cycles
v.n <- c("H", "S1", "S2", "D") # the 4 health states of the model:
                               # Healthy (H), Sick (S1), Sicker (S2), Dead (D)
n.s <- length(v.n) # number of health states 
d.c <- d.e <- 0.03 # equal discount of costs and QALYs by 3%
v.names.str <- c("Usual care", "New treatment") # store the strategy names

## Transition probabilities (per cycle)
p.HD    <- 0.002 # constant probability of dying when Healthy (all-cause mortality)
p.HS1   <- 0.15  # probability to become Sick when Healthy
p.S1H   <- 0.5   # probability to become Healthy when Sick
p.S1S2  <- 0.105 # probability to become Sicker when Sick
hr.S1   <- 3     # hazard ratio of death in Sick vs Healthy
hr.S2   <- 10    # hazard ratio of death in Sicker vs Healthy 

## Cost and utility inputs 
# State rewards
c.H   <- 2000  # cost of remaining one cycle Healthy 
c.S1  <- 4000  # cost of remaining one cycle Sick 
c.S2  <- 15000 # cost of remaining one cycle Sicker 
c.D   <- 0     # cost of being dead (per cycle)
c.Trt <- 12000 # cost of treatment (per cycle) 

u.H   <- 1     # utility when Healthy 
u.S1  <- 0.75  # utility when Sick 
u.S2  <- 0.5   # utility when Sicker
u.D   <- 0     # utility when Sealthy 
u.Trt <- 0.95  # utility when being treated

# Transition rewards
du.HS1 <- 0.01  # disutility when transitioning from Healthy to Sick
ic.HS1 <- 1000  # increase in cost when transitioning from Healthy to Sick
ic.D   <- 2000  # increase in cost when dying
```

To compute the mortality risks from the Sick and Sicker states, we transform `p.HD` to a rate assuming a constant exponential rate, $-log(1 - p.HD)$, multiply it by the hazard ratios `hr.S1` and `hr.S2`, respectively, and then convert them back to a probability $p=-e^{-rt}$. See the R code below for more details on the calculations.

```{r Sick-Sicker-Params, eval=TRUE}
p.S1D  <- 1 - exp(log(1 - p.HD) * hr.S1) # probability of dying in Sick
p.S2D  <- 1 - exp(log(1 - p.HD) * hr.S2) # probability of dying in Sicker
```

```{r}
# create transition probability matrices for both treatment and no treatment
m.P_no_trt <- m.P_trt <- matrix(NA, nrow = n.s, ncol = n.s, 
                                byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(v.n, v.n))

# fill in the transition probability matrix
### from H
m.P_no_trt["H", "H"]  <- 1 - (p.HS1 + p.HD)
m.P_no_trt["H", "S1"] <- p.HS1

m.P_no_trt["H", "D"]  <- p.HD

### from S1
m.P_no_trt["S1", "H"]  <- p.S1H
m.P_no_trt["S1", "S1"] <- 1 - (p.S1H + p.S1S2 + p.S1D)
m.P_no_trt["S1", "S2"] <- p.S1S2
m.P_no_trt["S1", "D"]  <- p.S1D

### from S2
m.P_no_trt["S2", "H"]  <- 0
m.P_no_trt["S2", "S1"] <- 0
m.P_no_trt["S2", "S2"] <- 1 - p.S2D
m.P_no_trt["S2", "D"]  <- p.S2D

m.P_no_trt["D", "S1"]  <- 0
m.P_no_trt["D", "S2"]  <- 0 
m.P_no_trt["D", "D"]   <- 1

# the two transition probability matrices are the same
m.P_trt <- m.P_no_trt

# create the markov trace 
# matrix M is capturing the proportion of the cohort in each state at each cycle
m.M_no_trt <- m.M_trt <- matrix(NA, nrow = n.t + 1, ncol = n.s,
                                dimnames = list(paste("cycle", 0:n.t, sep = " "), v.n))

# The cohort starts as healthy
m.M_no_trt[1, ] <- m.M_trt[1, ] <- c(1, 0, 0, 0) # initiate the Markov trace 
head(m.M_no_trt)
```

Here you can see that only the first cycle of the Markov trace is filled. In the next section we will

table_Markov_SickSicker <- as.data.frame(table_Markov_SickSicker)    # create a data frame                                       
```

### Final results
The final results of the cost-effectiveness of the Sick-Sicker model are shown below. 
```{r, echo = FALSE,  resutls = 'asis'}
kable(table_Markov_SickSicker)
```
The treatment strategy is more expensive but gives us more QALYs. This results in an ICER of `r ICER[2]`. Assuming a willness to pay of $80000 we don't consider this treatment strategy cost-effective.
