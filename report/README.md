In this book we provide an example of how a report could be written in R Markdown by describing the use of the DARTH framework published in the paper **"A need for change! A coding framework for improving transparency in decision modeling"** in *PharmacoEconomics* using a case-example. 

We recommend first reading our paper before reading this book.

This is a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
